## Overview

This is a simple crud application created as a  JS react/redux project for flatiron school with a rails backend api.

## Installation

Clone this repo and configure front and backends. I recommend opening two terminals.

Backend (cd into parley-api):
```
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s -p 3001
```

Frontend (cd into parley-client):

npm install
npm start
```
